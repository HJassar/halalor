## About Halalor
Halalor is a simple app where you can search within a database of products to know whether they are *Halal* or not.
The app approaches products differently; it breaks down the components of brand products rather than give generic answers, then it investigates each product and shows whether there are any suspicious ingredients or processes related to the food. **It does not provide Fatwas**, or conclusions, about the product. It merely points out things that a Muslim needs to be aware of before purchasing the product.
